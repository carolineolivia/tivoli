copenhagencoaching.dk is made with jekyll and some javascript. It is made with the "why, how, what" concept and on the front we used the fullpage plugin. The design is made entirely by [Benjamin](https://http://bennessy.dk/){:target="_blank"}.
It has a lot of different collections, to ensure all of the different products. It has two forms from formspree and is set up to be edited in prose.io.
