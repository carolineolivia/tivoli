prolike.io is the website of my workplace, and it was here i was first introduced to jekyll, and the cleverness of hosting your website on github. I build the website in collaberation with my colleage Benjamin, who also designed it. The comercial messege of the site is based on the "why, how, what" concept. It mainly contains of the frontpage made with the fullpage plugin. It has two collections, our gigs and posts. Gigs; where we show our projects, and posts where we tell our stories.
